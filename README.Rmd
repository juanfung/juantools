# juantools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

juantools bundles a few helper functions that I use a lot, so I am packaging them for ease of
loading!

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("juanfung/juantools")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(juantools)
## basic example code
thou_sep(1000)

thou_sep(10000)
```
